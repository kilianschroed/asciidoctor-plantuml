= Sample

== Update

Thanks to the help of @pepijnve this is working in the meantime. The crucial corrections where:

- Removing the Asciidoctor syntax in the PlantUML files (i.e. `[plantuml]`, `....`-blocks etc.)
- Using `plantuml::…` instead of `include::…` syntax for pulling in the files into the Asciidoctor document

== The problem

Sample to show relative imports within PlantUML not working in Asciidoctor if the UML files are not in the Asciidoctor root path.

== Steps to reproduce

* Have a recent Java installed
* Clone the repo
* `./mvnw clean package`
* Open `target/generated-docs/index.html`

The image displayed reports the import to be erroneous.
